## What You Need
 
Before you start, make sure you have the following items:
 
- The Silvercrest swv 300 b2 dual-band wifi range extender
- A power outlet near your router
- A power outlet near the area where you want to extend the wifi coverage
- A computer or a mobile device with wifi capability
- Your wireless router's network name (SSID) and password (if any)

## Step 1: Plug in the Extender
 
First, plug the extender into a power outlet near your router. Wait for about a minute until the power/WPS LED (3) lights up solid green. This means that the extender is ready for setup.
 
## Step 2: Connect to the Extender
 
Next, use your computer or mobile device to connect to the extender's wifi network. The network name (SSID) is "SilverCrest SWV 300 B2" followed by a random number, such as "SilverCrest SWV 300 B2\_1234". The default password is "12345678". You can find these information on the label at the back of the extender.
 
Once you are connected, open a web browser and enter "http://re.silvercrest.com" in the address bar. This will take you to the configuration menu of the extender.
 
## Step 3: Configure the Extender
 
In the configuration menu, you can choose between two modes: repeater mode or setting mode. Repeater mode is recommended if you want to copy your router's wifi settings and extend them to another area. Setting mode is recommended if you want to create a separate wifi network with different settings from your router.
 
### Repeater Mode
 
If you choose repeater mode, follow these steps:

1. Select your router's wifi network from the list of available networks. If you don't see your network, click on "Refresh". If your network is hidden, click on "Other..." and enter your network name (SSID) manually.
2. Enter your router's wifi password (if any) and click on "Next".
3. The extender will automatically copy your router's wifi settings and apply them to both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. You can change the network name (SSID) and password of each band if you want. Click on "Next" when you are done.
4. The extender will reboot and apply the settings. Wait for about two minutes until the 2.4G signal LED (1) or the 5G signal LED (2) lights up solid green. This means that the connection has been successfully established.
5. You can now unplug the extender and move it to a location where you want to extend the wifi coverage. Plug it into a power outlet and wait for about a minute until the signal LEDs light up solid green. You can use any of the two wifi networks (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) that have been extended by the extender.

### Setting Mode
 
If you choose setting mode, follow these steps:
