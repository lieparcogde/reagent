Magnetic stripe cards are widely used for various purposes, such as credit cards, drivers licenses, membership cards, and more. They store data on one or more tracks of magnetic material embedded on the card surface. To read or write data on these cards, you need a device called a magnetic stripe reader/writer, such as the Msr900 Card Reader Software 33.
